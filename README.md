This project is to predict the "financial distress" of employees in the future. the dataset can't be share to public domain to maintain the integrity of the organisation. 

The stakeholder's requirement is to predict categorically (financially health/financially distressed), however, this categorical prediction is derived from a numerical data.if the variable "income" is above taxable threshold, the individual is considered healthy. Otherwise, it is considered distressed.
 
 In this project i decided to use classification model to predict the taxable income which further splitted into two categories "good" and "risky".
 
 Notes on raw data:
  All the columns have labels and have some correlation relation with target column. there are total 28 columns in the dataset.
